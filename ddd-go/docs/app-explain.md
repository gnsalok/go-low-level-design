Here's an explanation of each component under the ddd-go directory, based on the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

### 1. **`cmd/`**
   - **Purpose**: This folder contains the entry point of the application.
   - **File: main.go**
     - This is the main executable file that initializes the application.
     - It sets up the HTTP server and starts listening for incoming requests.
     - Example: In this case, it initializes the router from the infrastructure layer and starts the server.

---

### 2. **`internal/`**
   - **Purpose**: This folder contains the core logic of the application, divided into subfolders based on DDD layers.

#### a. **`domain/`**
   - **Purpose**: Represents the core business logic and rules of the application.
   - **Subfolders**:
     1. **`entities/`**:
        - Contains the core domain entities, which are the primary objects in the business model.
        - Example: A `User` entity might represent a user in the system with attributes like `ID`, `Name`, and `Email`.
     2. **`repositories/`**:
        - Defines interfaces for data persistence.
        - Example: A `UserRepository` interface might define methods like `Save`, `FindByID`, and `Delete`.
        - These interfaces are implemented in the infrastructure layer.
     3. **`services/`**:
        - Contains domain services, which encapsulate business logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object.
        - Example: A `UserService` might handle complex operations like user registration or password reset.

---

#### b. **`application/`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains application-specific logic, such as use cases or application services.
   - **Subfolders**:
     - **`usecases/`**:
       - Implements specific use cases of the application.
       - Example: A `CreateUserUseCase` might handle the process of creating a new user by orchestrating calls to the domain layer and infrastructure layer.

---

#### c. **`infrastructure/`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains implementation details for external systems and frameworks.
   - **Subfolders**:
     1. **`http/`**:
        - Handles HTTP-related functionality, such as routing and controllers.
        - Example: A `handler.go` file might define HTTP handlers for endpoints like users or `/login`.
     2. **`database/`**:
        - Handles database-related functionality, such as connections and repository implementations.
        - Example: A `db.go` file might define the database connection logic, and repository implementations might interact with the database.

---

### 3. **`go.mod` and go.sum**
   - **Purpose**: These files define the Go module and its dependencies.
   - **`go.mod`**: Specifies the module name and required dependencies.
   - **`go.sum`**: Contains checksums for the module's dependencies to ensure integrity.

---

### 4. **`README.md`**
   - **Purpose**: Provides documentation for the ddd-go project.
   - **Content**: Typically includes an overview of the project, how to set it up, and how to run it.

---

### Summary of Responsibilities:
- **`cmd/`**: Application entry point.
- **`internal/domain/`**: Core business logic (entities, repositories, services).
- **`internal/application/`**: Application-specific logic (use cases).
- **`internal/infrastructure/`**: External system integrations (HTTP, database).
- **`go.mod` and go.sum**: Dependency management.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

This structure ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the application easier to maintain, test, and extend.

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), **Entities** and **Value Objects** are two fundamental building blocks of the domain model. Here's an explanation of each:

---

### **Entity**
- **Definition**: An entity is an object that is defined by its unique identity rather than its attributes. It represents a concept in the domain that has a distinct lifecycle and identity.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  1. **Identity**: Each entity has a unique identifier (e.g., `ID`) that distinguishes it from other entities, even if their attributes are identical.
  2. **Mutable**: Entities often have mutable state, meaning their attributes can change over time, but their identity remains constant.
  3. **Lifecycle**: Entities typically have a lifecycle (e.g., created, updated, deleted).
- **Example**:
  In the provided code, the `User` struct in the `entities` package is likely an entity because:
  - It represents a user in the system.
  - It has attributes like `Name` and `Email`.
  - It would typically have a unique identifier (e.g., `ID`).

---

### **Value Object**
- **Definition**: A value object is an object that is defined by its attributes rather than a unique identity. It represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  1. **No Identity**: Value objects do not have a unique identifier. Two value objects with the same attributes are considered equal.
  2. **Immutable**: Value objects are typically immutable, meaning their state cannot change after they are created.
  3. **Reusable**: Value objects can be reused across entities or other value objects.
- **Example**:
  A `FullName` struct with `FirstName` and `LastName` fields could be a value object. It doesn't need a unique identifier because its identity is derived from its attributes.

---

### **How to Decide Between Entity and Value Object**
- Use an **entity** when:
  - The object has a unique identity that must be tracked.
  - The object has a lifecycle or state that changes over time.
- Use a **value object** when:
  - The object is defined solely by its attributes.
  - The object is immutable and can be replaced rather than modified.

---

### Example in Context
If the `User` struct in your `entities` package looks like this:

```go
package entities

type User struct {
	ID    string
	Name  string
	Email string
}
```

- This is an **entity** because:
  - It has a unique `ID` that identifies it.
  - Its `Name` and `Email` can change over time, but the `ID` remains constant.

If you had a `FullName` struct like this:

```go
type FullName struct {
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
}
```

- This is a **value object** because:
  - It has no unique identifier.
  - Two `FullName` objects with the same `FirstName` and `LastName` are considered equal.
  - It is immutable (you would create a new `FullName` object rather than modifying an existing one).

---

### Summary
- **Entity**: Defined by identity, mutable, tracks lifecycle.
- **Value Object**: Defined by attributes, immutable, reusable.
