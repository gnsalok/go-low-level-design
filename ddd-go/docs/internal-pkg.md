In Go, the `/internal` directory is a convention used to restrict access to certain packages or code within a module. Code placed under the `/internal` directory can only be imported by other code within the same module. This is enforced by the Go compiler and is a way to encapsulate implementation details and prevent external packages from depending on internal code.

### **When Should You Use the `/internal` Directory?**

1. **Encapsulation of Internal Logic**:
   - Use `/internal` for code that is not meant to be consumed by external modules or packages.
   - This includes implementation details that are specific to your application and should not be exposed as part of your public API.

2. **Preventing Accidental Usage**:
   - Placing code in `/internal` ensures that it cannot be imported by other modules, reducing the risk of accidental misuse or dependency on internal implementation details.

3. **Domain-Specific Logic**:
   - Code that is specific to your application's domain (e.g., business logic, repositories, services) should typically go under `/internal`.

4. **Infrastructure Code**:
   - Code related to infrastructure (e.g., database connections, HTTP handlers, third-party integrations) that is not reusable outside the module should also go under `/internal`.

5. **Application-Specific Utilities**:
   - Utility functions or helpers that are specific to your application and not intended for reuse in other projects can be placed in `/internal`.

### **Examples of When to Use `/internal`**

#### **Good Candidates for `/internal`**
- **Domain Logic**:
  - Entities, repositories, and services that are specific to your application's domain.
- **Infrastructure Code**:
  - Database connection logic, HTTP handlers, or third-party integrations.
- **Application-Specific Use Cases**:
  - Use cases or application services that orchestrate domain logic.
- **Internal Utilities**:
  - Helper functions or utilities that are not reusable outside the module.

#### **Not Suitable for `/internal`**
- **Reusable Libraries**:
  - Code that is generic and reusable across multiple projects should go in a separate package or module, not under `/internal`.
- **Public APIs**:
  - Code that is intended to be consumed by external modules should not be placed under `/internal`.

### **Example Directory Structure**

```plaintext
my-app/
├── cmd/                     # Entry points for the application (e.g., main.go)
│   └── main.go
├── internal/                # Internal code, not accessible outside the module
│   ├── domain/              # Domain-specific logic
│   │   ├── entities/        # Core domain entities
│   │   ├── repositories/    # Repository interfaces
│   │   └── services/        # Domain services
│   ├── application/         # Application-specific logic (use cases)
│   └── infrastructure/      # Infrastructure code (e.g., database, HTTP)
│       ├── database/
│       └── http/
├── pkg/                     # Optional: Public reusable libraries
│   └── utils/               # Generic utilities
├── go.mod                   # Go module file
└── README.md

### **Benefits of Using `/internal`**
1. **Encapsulation**: Keeps internal implementation details hidden from external consumers.
2. **Cleaner API**: Encourages a clear separation between public and private code.
3. **Reduced Coupling**: Prevents external dependencies on internal code, making refactoring easier.

---

### **When Not to Use `/internal`**
- If your project is a library or package intended for reuse, avoid placing reusable code under `/internal`. Instead, use the `/pkg` directory or the root module for public APIs.

---

### **Conclusion**
Use the `/internal` directory for code that is specific to your application and should not be exposed to external modules. This helps enforce encapsulation, reduces coupling, and makes your codebase easier to maintain.
