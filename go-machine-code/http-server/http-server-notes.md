Certainly! `\r\n` is a sequence of two characters:

- `\r` stands for "carriage return" (ASCII 13)
- `\n` stands for "line feed" or "newline" (ASCII 10)

Together, `\r\n` is used as a line ending in many network protocols, including HTTP. It marks the end of a line in HTTP headers and the end of the header section itself.

For example, an HTTP request line and headers look like this:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: example.com\r\n
\r\n
```
The empty line (`\r\n`) after the headers signals the end of the header section.
