Use this official doc : https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/which-terraform-workflow-should-i-use-vcs-cli-or-api for evaluating the use of Terraform VCS-based workflow versus Terraform CLI-based workflow for managing multiple environments (dev, stage, prod) from a single code repository.

Please explore each approach across the following dimensions:
- Setup efforts
- Maintenance efforts
- Security concerns
- Architectural and process complexity

Based on this analysis, recommend the most suitable approach for a team of developers working on shared infrastructure with multiple environments. Include rationale for your recommendation.

Please add code examples (if needed) to support the recommendation as well.

Make sure break the ADRs in below heading and :- 

- Context and Problem Statement
- Decision Driver
- Considered Options : VCS, CLI and API driven workflow
- Decision Outcome
- Pro and cons of other options

Note: Make sure to write ADR in short and bulleted point so that it's easy to read?
