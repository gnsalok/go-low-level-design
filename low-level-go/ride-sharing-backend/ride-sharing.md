## Price Calculation Strategy

Examples of fare calculations :

Scenario 1: Heavy Traffic
- Distance: 5 miles (takes 45 minutes)
- Distance Only: 5 × $1.50 = $7.50 (unfair to driver—wasted 45 min)
- Time Only: 45 × $0.25 = $11.25 (unfair to rider—short distance)
- Both: $2.50 + $7.50 + $11.25 = $21.25 ✓ (fair balance)

Scenario 2: Highway Speed
- Distance: 20 miles (takes 20 minutes)
- Distance Only: 20 × $1.50 = $30 (driver compensated well)
- Time Only: 20 × $0.25 = $5 (driver severely underpaid)
- Both: $2.50 + $30 + $5 = $37.50 ✓ (fair balance)
